# AeroShed-AI
A constraint-aware scheduler that takes simplified aviation-like data, detects conflicts, and re-optimizes when disruption happens.

## About
Flight disruptions like weather delays and crew shortages cause scheduling chaos in aviation. AeroShed-AI predicts conflicts and automatically re-optimizes schedules to reduce delays and improve operational robustness.

## Motivation
We built AeroShed-AI for Microsoft Imagine Cup to create a smarter, AI-driven solution for airport scheduling challenges — blending machine learning and constraint optimization to minimize disruptions.

## Features
- Predicts flight-related disruptions using ML models
- Detects scheduling conflicts
- Re-optimizes schedules automatically
- Visual before/after comparison
  
## Tech Stack
- Python
- Azure Notebooks
- Constraint optimization
- Machine learning models (e.g., scikit-learn)

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/s-hreya184/AeroShed-AI.git

pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
Clearly telling users how to *run the code* is essential. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
